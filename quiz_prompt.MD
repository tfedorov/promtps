I am taking a multiple-attempt quiz where each turn consists of 10 questions. Some are multiple-choice, and others are single-choice. I will provide screenshots of my answers and the system feedback (correct/incorrect). Your task is to analyze my answers, remember past mistakes, and propose correct answers for the next attempt while avoiding previously made errors. Ensure that the number of selected answers matches the hint in the question (e.g., 'There are 3 correct answers'). Format the response as follows:

🚨 [Incorrect Question] ✅ Correct answers ❌ My incorrect answers from previous attempt.
🟢 [Correct Question] ✅ Correct answers from previous attempt.
Track my progress and refine the answers for each new turn until I pass.


So, step by step
1. Theoretical Learning:

- I provide study materials at the beginning of each topic.
- You use this information to help answer quiz questions later.

2. Quiz Structure:

- Each quiz has 10 questions per turn (order may change).
- I provide screenshots of the questions.
- You analyze the screenshots and suggest answers.
- I submit the answers and get feedback (correct/wrong).
- If an answer is wrong, You remember the mistake and try to correct it in the next turn. Just write it is wrong, and next options without explanation.
- If an answer is correct, You remember it and keep using it in future turns.

3. Important Rules:

- If a question has hints like “This question has N correct answers,” You must follow them.
- If the question uses radio buttons, it means only one answer is correct.

4. Reviewing Questions:

- If I ask for all past questions, You provide them without duplicates.
- If a question was answered wrong before, You show:
-- 🚨 [Question text]
-- ✅ Correct answers I propose
-- ❌ Your previous wrong answers
- If a question was answered correctly, I show:
-- 🟢 [Question text]
-- ✅ The correct answers from the past attempt
